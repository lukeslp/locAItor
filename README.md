# üìç Where Was This Photo Taken? (Demo)

A Flask-based demo app to pinpoint where a photo was taken using both visual cues and comprehensive image metadata. The app also detects and flags AI-generated or synthetic images using metadata and visual analysis.

---

## Features

- **Location Detection:** Uses xAI Grok-Vision to identify the most specific location possible (landmarks, city, region).
- **Comprehensive Metadata Extraction:** Extracts EXIF, XMP, and ICC profile data for every uploaded image.
- **AI/Synthetic Image Detection:**
  - Scans metadata for known AI generator tags (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney, C2PA, etc.).
  - Flags images with missing or suspicious metadata (e.g., no camera model).
  - LLM prompt asks for both location and AI/synthetic status, with reasoning.
- **Accessible API:** Returns both the LLM's answer and all extracted metadata for transparency.
- **Frontend:** Simple, accessible drag-and-drop UI (see `templates/index.html`).

## Setup & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors pillow requests pillow-heif pyheif piexif
   ```
2. **Set API credentials:**
   - The app uses environment variables for the xAI API key and model, but defaults are provided for demo purposes.
3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Open in browser:**
   - Go to [http://127.0.0.1:5002](http://127.0.0.1:5002)

## API Endpoint

### `POST /analyze`

- **Request:**
  - `multipart/form-data` with an `image` file field.
- **Response:**
  - `content`: LLM's answer (location + AI/synthetic status)
  - `metadata`: Dictionary containing:
    - `exif`: Extracted EXIF metadata (JPEG/PNG)
    - `heic_exif`: Extracted EXIF metadata from HEIC (if present)
    - `xmp_icc`: Extracted XMP and ICC profile data
    - `ai_generated`: Boolean, whether AI generator was detected
    - `ai_reason`: Reason for AI/synthetic flag
  - `gps`: GPS coordinates (if found), as `{ "lat": float, "lon": float }`

#### Example Response
```json
{
  "content": "This photo was taken at the Eiffel Tower, Paris. The image appears to be real, as the metadata includes a camera model and no AI generator tags are present.",
  "metadata": {
    "exif": {"Model": "Canon EOS 80D", ...},
    "heic_exif": {"Model": "Canon EOS 80D", ...},
    "xmp_icc": {"icc": "ICC profile present"},
    "ai_generated": false,
    "ai_reason": "No AI generator tags found.",
    "gps": {"lat": 48.8584, "lon": 2.2945}
  }
}
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- All API responses are structured for easy parsing and screen reader compatibility.
- The frontend (see `templates/index.html`) uses semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and high-contrast color schemes.
- Error messages are clear and accessible.

## Changelog
See `CHANGELOG.md` for updates.

## Image Format Support & Processing

- **Supported formats:** JPEG, PNG, HEIC/HEIF (with `pillow-heif` installed)
- **Automatic conversion:** HEIC/HEIF images are converted to JPEG for processing and API submission.
- **EXIF from HEIC:** If `pyheif` and `piexif` are installed, EXIF is extracted from HEIC before conversion for maximum metadata fidelity.
- **Resizing:** Images are resized to a maximum dimension of 2048px if needed, and compressed to stay under 10MiB (xAI API limit).
- **Error handling:** Unsupported or oversized images are rejected with a clear error message.

**To enable full HEIC/HEIF support:**
```bash
pip install pillow-heif pyheif piexif
```

## CLI Test Suite (Planned)

A CLI test script (`cli_test.py`) will allow you to:
- Upload images (JPEG, PNG, HEIC) to the `/analyze` endpoint
- Validate metadata extraction, AI detection, and API response
- Test image resizing/conversion pipeline
- Run batch tests for regression and automation
